# API-live-crypto-tracker
A simple Python project that demonstrates how to interact with a public API (CoinGecko) to fetch real-time data, save it to a CSV file, and visualize the results in a bar chart. This project is designed as a beginner-friendly example of working with REST APIs, handling JSON responses, and automating periodic data collection using Python.
